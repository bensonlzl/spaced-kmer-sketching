# Spaced K-mer Sketching

This codebase provides a (somewhat) performant set of functions for K-mer sketching with spaced seeds in C++.

## What are K-mers?

K-mers are contiguous substrings of a fixed length, usually used in the context of genomic or proteomic data.
For example, the nucleotide string `ACCGTAAATTCGA` consists of the 5-mers

- `ACCGT`
- `CCGTA`
- `CGTAA`
- `GTAAA`
- `TAAAT`
- `AAATT`
- `AATTC`
- `ATTCG`
- `TTCGA`
